# Animal-Type-Detection-Model
Overview
This project aims to classify animal types using machine learning models, specifically for images of goats, pigs, and cows. Leveraging advanced object detection techniques, this repository demonstrates the use of YOLOv8 to build and train a robust detection model.

Features
Preprocessing and augmentation of datasets to address class imbalance.
Training and fine-tuning a pre-trained YOLOv8n model.
Implementation of evaluation metrics such as IoU, AP@50, and mAP@50.
Integration of oversampling for underrepresented classes.
Model optimization using hyperparameter tuning.
Dataset
The dataset contains labeled images of goats, pigs, and cows.

Images are divided into training, validation, and test sets.
Class imbalance is mitigated through oversampling techniques applied to minority classes.
